# Airline Fare Prediction Project
Welcome to the **Airline Fare Prediction Project!** This project aims to predict airline fares using historical data on U.S. airline routes. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict fare prices based on a variety of factors. Alongside this, the project explores potential business applications of fare prediction, such as market research, travel demand analysis, and route optimization.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Understanding the Data: The dataset presents a complex challenge due to the presence of unrelated or noisy data, making it difficult to identify clear patterns. Despite this, a thorough EDA has been conducted to gain insights into the structure and relationships within the data.
Key Insights: The EDA revealed that significant data preprocessing and feature engineering would be necessary to improve model performance. Identifying outliers, missing data, and correlations between variables are crucial steps in refining the model.

### 2. Model Development

- **Initial Model:** A Linear Regression model was the first approach, yielding an RMSE of 27.76. While this indicates some level of predictive capability, it also underscores the complexity of predicting fares in the airline industry due to the diverse range of influencing factors.
Next Steps: Further work will involve more advanced models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy. Potential techniques include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks.

### 3. Potential Applications

- **Travel Demand Analysis:** This model can help identify popular routes and understand seasonal variations in passenger traffic.
- **Market Research:** Airlines and businesses can use fare predictions to analyze competition and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
- **Route Optimization:** The data can be leveraged by airlines to evaluate existing routes and discover new ones with high passenger demand.
- **Business Intelligence:** Various industries can use travel pattern insights to inform strategic decisions, such as market expansion or resource allocation.
